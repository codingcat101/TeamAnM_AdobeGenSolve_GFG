We have acheived interpolating and regularizing data involves smoothing with interpolated points, simplifying polylines by removing collinear points, and comparing Bezier curves using error metrics. Image processing includes edge detection, shape classification (e.g., stars, ellipses), and drawing shapes. Data visualization covers plotting paths, neural network preprocessing, and model evaluation. Core functions include CSV reading, RDP algorithm, symmetry reflection, and testing new data.
